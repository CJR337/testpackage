TLF Production & Validation, 2.) Subject Narrative/Patient Profile Production & Validation, 3.) Graphical Sandbox. Select links view videos corresponding sections. TLF Patient Profile framework includes bundled PDFs RTFs along user-interfaces CSR ad-hoc reporting. , TLF acronym tables, listings figures. full working prototype demonstrated within videos, released youtube. hello() adds new variables functions existing variables framework, TLF Patient Profile delivery generated launching shell file prompt user run ID. metadata read run ID corresponding TLFs Patient Profiles generated. Based number cores available, can background process fixed number TLFs Patient Profiles save time. outputs generated, post-processors launched bundling, bookmarking, linking. table contents generated, issue report scanning log files. also use log files identify functions invoked run, copy hyperlink code. Lastly, TLF Patient Profile files zipped delivery relevant stakeholders. graphical sandbox collection 12 distinct figure types GUIs allow clinical study team quickly generate exploratory data analyses.
